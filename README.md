Description
### [number_to_word](https://github.com/sachaparakenil/number_to_word) is my project for PlayStore and AppStore.

There are six main functions in total for the Number to Word Converter App.
1.	Number to Word: With just one click, number to word can change huge amounts into words. It also contains share, clear, copy, talk, and voice-to-text features.
2.	Word to Number: It quickly changes long words into numbers and displays an error box when the input is incorrect. It also contains features for sharing, clearing, copying, and speaking to offer more clarity.
3.	Even Odd Number: It features a button for odd and even numbers, which will give the user a list of both even and odd numbers along with their spellings. Furthermore, it contains controls to manually control the screen's start, pause, restart, copy, time interval, and volume. In addition, a speech feature that pronounces the numbers is available.
4.	Roman numerals: It offers a copy option when the user clicks on the button for any of the numbers from 1 to 2000 in numeric form as well as Roman numerals.
5.	One, two, three: the pronunciation of each number covers the range from 1 to 100. Additionally, it has controls to manually adjust the volume, time interval, start, pause, and restart of the screen.
6.	Number spelling: It has a range of 0 to 100 numbers, and one of its key characteristics is that it pronounces the spelling using pronouns for the numbers. as well as tools like a volume control and buttons for play, pause, restart, copying numbers and spellings, and time interval.
